        <p>I love to eat! Fortunately for me there are lots of places to enjoy a great meal in St. Louis. I will talk
            about my four go-to favorites.</p>

            <h1> Wildflower Restaurant</h1>
            <img src="images/wildflower.jpg" alt="Wildflower Restaurant" class="center" />
            <p>The Wild Flower Restaurant & Catering was created in 1995 by owner, Tracy Czarnec. Her vision was to
                bring together American gourmet dining with a casual atmosphere. The decision to open in the Central
                West End seemed natural. A trendy area with a cosmopolitan feel, the West End turned out to be the
                perfect place for the Wild Flower and diners looking for more than just another restaurant. </p>
